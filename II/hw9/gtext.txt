This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and your stones, throw your bombs and your blows
But you're not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
I just wanna throw my phone away
Find out who is really there for me
You ripped me off your love was cheap 
Was always tearing at the seams
I fell deep and you let me down
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me
Now look at me I'm sparkling
A firework, a dancing flame
You'll never put me out again
I'm glowin' oh whoa
So you can keep the diamond ring
It don't mean nothing anyway
In fact you can keep everything yeah yeah
Except for me
